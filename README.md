## Part 1: Imaging Technique Inspiration
### Creating a landscape using grainy/particle effects
-	Gao Yang (Particle) creates stunning mountain landscapes using a grainy, particle effect. Colours are striking and rich and the effect gives the illusion of flowing sand.
-	I believe such a technique would be interesting to apply to Monet or Munch or Kooning’s piece from the assignment through creating animated movement, such as flowing water (Monet), or the feeling of movement in the background (Much and Kooning). I believe Munch’s work especially lends itself well to this technique due to the style of brush stroke.
-	It would also be interesting to experiment with saturated colours.
